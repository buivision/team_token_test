# Workspace Configuration

This directory contains the Terraform configuration for a test workspace that demonstrates the usage of the team token generated by the parent configuration.

## Files

- `main.tf` - Contains the provider and backend configuration for the workspace
- `random_test.tf` - Generates random resources to test workspace functionality
- `setup.sh` - Script to initialize and apply the workspace configuration

## Usage

1. Ensure the parent configuration has been applied and has outputs:
   ```bash
   terraform output
   ```

2. Run the setup script:
   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```

The script will:
- Retrieve the team token and TFE hostname from the parent configuration
- Initialize the workspace with the team token for authentication
- Apply the configuration to create random test resources

## Outputs

The configuration generates:
- Three random pet names
- Three random strings
- A mapping of pet names to their corresponding random strings

## Security

- The workspace uses the team token for authentication
- All sensitive information is handled via environment variables
- The backend configuration is dynamically set using the parent configuration's outputs
